                      I have quite a few interests.
					  One of my favourite will be playing video games.<br>
                      Playing video games tend to make me draw out intensity.
                      I used to be a semi-competitive gamer<br>
                      But as I grew older, reaction and capability declines, so now I just play for fun.<br><br>

					  Counter Strike is one of my favourite!<br><br>

					  <b>As a Information Technology student, I would like to be able to do Programming and GameMaking<br>
					  As both of these fields are different, I like to challenge myself in trying new things. <br>
					  Because I enjoy both of these fields. If there were a chance take up both<br>
					  I'll be more than willingly to accept that offer, because it is my goal.<br>
